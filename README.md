### Brief:

This project has been done as cryptography course project, Monsoon semester 2021. It
demonstrates the Chacha20 cipher, Blake2b-512 HMAC, and their combined authenticated encryption mode.

We provide both command-line and GUI based usage options.




### Requirements:

#### Command line:
- C++17

#### GUI:
- C++17
- Node JS - evented I/O for the backend
- React - library for building user interfaces


### Installation and Usage

This project requires C++ v17 compiler, make sure you have gcc installed.
***
**Run via Command Line Interface**
InputFiles : Input Files Directory
OutputFiles: Output Files Directory

| Input File Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| input_plain_txt_message.txt | Any arbitrary length string |
| chacha20_key.txt | 32 byte key |
| chacha20_nonce.txt | 12 byte nonce |
| chacha20_counter.txt | A 32-bit block count parameter (can be any number, but usually set to 0 or 1) |
| blake2b-512_key.txt | Variable length key (0 <= key size in bytes <= 64) |
| blake2b-512_digest_size.txt | The number of bytes the user wants in the hash, the maximum is 64 |

After setting up the inputs in the above files, run the following command for encryption or authenticated-encryption
( blake2b-512 files are required during authenticated operation)

```
bash execute.sh  [0:without authentication, 1:with authentication] [0: disable forging, 1: forged by adversary]

```


The Result/Output will be written in the OutputFiles Directory

| Output File Name| Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| decrypted_text.txt | Decrypted text |
| cipher_text_generated_by_Alice.txt | Cipher text generated by Alice |
| cipher_text_reaching_Bob.txt | Cipher text reaching Bob |
| hash_alice | Hash of Alice |
| hash_bob | Hash of Bob |
| tag_verification_result.txt | Result of tag verificartion |



Note: To just see the HMAC for any given text string, run run the following command:

```
bash execute.sh 

```
In this case, files related to chacha20 cipher in the Input directory are ignored, and only 1 output file: hmac_demonstration.txt is produced.


***
**Run via Graphical User Interface**
Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+.
```
sudo apt install npm
sudo apt install nodejs
```
To verify the installation
```
npm --version
node --version
```

Go to the project's root directory and install all the dependency and start the server.

```
cd Crypto-Project
npm install
npm start
```
Once the server gets started head over to http://localhost:3000 the access the GUI
